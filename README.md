## Git command line cheat sheet

* `git add (name of file)`
* `git commit -m "commit message"`
* `git push` - pushes changes to the server

* `git pull` - pulls changes from the server
* `git status` - tells you which files were changes
* `git diff` - tells you the changes that were made to each file

* `git checkout` lets you navigate between branches
* `git checkout -b 'new-name'` - creates a new branch from the branch that you're currently on/open
* `git branch` - lists all of your git branches
* `git stash` - undo EVERYTHING while retaining committed changes
