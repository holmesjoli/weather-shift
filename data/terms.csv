1,Tropical cyclone,"A low-pressure system that forms over tropical waters with swirling winds. Hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones fall under this category. The difference between those three types of storms is geographical.",TRUE,Freezing-Rain
2,Bomb Cyclone,A rapid pressure drop in a low-pressure air mass resulting in a pressure gradient where winds pick up sharply,TRUE,Freezing-Rain
3,Bombogenesis/Cyclogenesis,An atmospheric process where barometric pressure drops suddenly leading to the createion of a bomb cyclone,TRUE,Freezing-Rain
4,Atmospheric River,Describes regions in the atmosphere that transport moisture from the tropics to northern latitudes,TRUE,Freezing-Rain
5,Evaporative Demand,"A cyclical process where ground dries out more quickly in areas with high sun exposure and warmer temperatures. Warmer group releases more heat causing a ""thirstier"" environment.",TRUE,Freezing-Rain
6,Supercell,"A destructive type of thunderstorm defined by its powerful, rotating winds, sometimes resulting in tornadoes",TRUE,Freezing-Rain
7,Snowmaggedon/Snowpocalypse,A huge dump of snow creating blizzard-like conditions,FALSE,Snow
8,Polar Vortex,"Is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding both of the Earth’s poles. It is a seasonal phenomenon, which is weaker in summer and stronger in winter. The term ‘vortex’ refers to the counterclockwise flow of air that helps keep the colder air near the poles.",TRUE,Windy
9,Flash Drought,A period of abnormally high temperatures can lead to this weather phenomenon where high evaporation rates then lead to intense downpours,TRUE,Freezing-Rain
10,Derecho,A fast moving complex of thunderstorms,TRUE,Freezing-Rain
11,ARkStorm,"An apocalyptic megastorm named in reference to the Noachian, biblical flood",TRUE,Freezing-Rain
12,Pineapple Express,A type of atmospheric river where moisture builds up in the tropical Pacific,TRUE,Freezing-Rain
