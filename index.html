                    Bomb cyclones, Arctic blasts, Snowmaggedon. In recent years, weather terminology in the media has 
                    taken on new dimensions of drama to reflect the increasing trend in weather extremes.

                <p>
                    Co-opting technical meteorological terms to describe the weather for a general audience is unhelpful 
                    at best and outright misleading at worst. Nevertheless, media outlets continue to borrow these highly 
                    technical terms hoping to lend credibility to their reporting by utilizing jargon. Furthermore, 
                    technical terms add an element of drama that furthers storytelling. For example, the term &quot;polar 
                    vortex&quot; is used in everyday parlance to describe abnormally cold weather. In scientific 
                    literature, the &quot;polar vortex&quot; refers to the eastward flow of high altitude air around the 
                    poles. While technical wording can lend weather reports a veneer of scientific credibility, media 
                    outlets often use weather terms in reductionistic ways, heightening the risk of inaccuracies.
